## 🎮 Gameplay  

### 🎯 Objective  

The player's task is to defeat **five rows of eleven invaders** *(three different types)*.  

Waves of aliens move toward the bottom of the screen, bouncing horizontally off the side boundaries of the map.  

### 🕹️ Controls  

The player controls a **spaceship** equipped with a **laser cannon**. Movement is limited to horizontal navigation at the bottom of the screen, shooting at incoming aliens.  

- **⬅ Move Left** – `Left Arrow / A`  
- **➡ Move Right** – `Right Arrow / D`  
- **🔫 Shoot** – `Spacebar`  

### 🏆 Scoring  

Points are earned by eliminating **aliens**, and the game also tracks **survival time**.  

> **The longer the player survives and the more aliens are defeated, the faster the remaining enemies move.**  

Time starts at **0**.  

### ❤️ Lives

A life is lost if:
